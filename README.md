Local development: run on `localhost`. Database required: **MongoDB** (not included).

**Notes:**

- **Removed features (2026-01-08):** The admin dashboard and client-side analytics (stored in `localStorage`) were removed for privacy and maintainability reasons.
- To reintroduce analytics safely, implement a server-side analytics pipeline with opt-in consent and proper data retention policies; add authenticated admin UI backed by a secure backend.
